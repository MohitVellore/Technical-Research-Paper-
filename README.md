# Mathematical Modelling of the Peloton

## Overview
This repository contains the code and report for my technical research project on the dynamics of the peloton, completed as part of my Bachelor of Engineering degree at the University of Bristol.

## Project Description
The project investigates the cooperative and competitive strategies in competetive sports with a focus on professional road cycling and the dynamics of a two-player game. By using mathematical models and game theory, the study explores how riders optimise their performance through cooperation and strategic decision-making.

## Report
The full project report can be found [Report]([./Dynamics_of_Peloton_Report.pdf](https://github.com/MohitVellore/Technical-Research-Paper-/blob/main/Dynamics_of_Peloton_Report.pdf)).

## Key Features
- **Agent-Based Model**: Simulates the dynamics of riders within a two-player game.
- **Game Theory**: Explores cooperative and non-cooperative strategies using game-theoretic models.
- **Optimisation Techniques**: Utilises direct collocation and other optimisation methods to solve the equations of motion for cyclists.
